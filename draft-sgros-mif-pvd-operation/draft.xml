    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>
      The purpose of this draft is to analyze different options on
      how RA/RS messages can be used to configure multiple provisioning
      domains, both implicit and explicit. The draft lists options and
      arguments pro and con each option and then selects specific ones
      for the implementation. While analyzing pros and cons we take into
      account some real implementations and how they should be changed.

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Provisioning Domain characteristics">

      <section title="PvD content">

      <t>
      It is important to know what information belongs to a PvD. Namely,
      if there is PvD container option that holds all information belonging
      to a specific PvD then it is clear that information contained in the
      header of the RA message couldn't be included within container
      options. Information such as gatway addres, hop limit, router lifetime
      and timers, and flaggs M and O must be common to all content of the RA.
      </t>

      <t>
      PvD has to contain gateway address, one or more. The problem is that this
      information isn't an option and thus can not be embedded within a
      PvD container. So, all PvDs sent by some router will have the same gateway
      address. Note that multiple routers can send RAs with the _same_ PvD in
      it. In such cases gateway addresses are merged.
      </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Identifying implicit PvDs">

        <t>
        In this section we discuss how PvD aware clients should identify
        implicit PvDs they receive. Note that there is possibility to
        allow PvD ID option to be sent as any other option and in that
        way to "tag" configuration options within RA or a DHCP message.
        In this section we are concerned with a problem when configuration
        options are received witouth such an option or any other indication
        of the PvDs identity.
        </t>

        <t>
        The idea is to generate identifier of a set of configuration options
        that uniquely identify a PvD. In other words, whenever any element
        of the given set changes, that should be an indication of
        connectivity change. This set can then be hashed in order to
        produce UUID that would be used as PvD ID of the given
        connection. Furhtermore, the process of generating PvD ID
        could be prescribed so that all PvD aware nodes, receiving the
        same set of configuration parameters, would assign it the 
        same PvD ID.
        </t>

        <t>
        The following elements could comprise a set of parameters that
        uniquely identify PvD:
        </t>

        <t><list style="symbols">

          <t>
          All network prefix(es) used on a local network.
          </t>

          <t>
          Routes specific to a gateway that sent RA.
          </t>

          <t>
          Addresses of DNS servers.
          </t>

          <t>
          Domain names served by DNS servers.
          </t>

        </list></t>

        <t>
        Time values are not take in into account while determining to which
        PvD given configuration parameters belong to. Also, the following
        parameters are for consideration should they or not be taken into
        account when determining PvD identities:
        </t>

        <t><list style="symbols">

          <t>
          hop_limit
          </t>

          <t>
	  mtu
          </t>

          <t>
	  dhcp_level
          </t>

          <t>
	  Different lifetimes.
          </t>

        </list></t>

        <t>
        Note that in some cases there could be the same set of network(!)
        configuration parameters used on multipe different networks.
        This is the case with IPv4 private space in which IP network mask,
        gateway and DNS server combination doesn't have to be unique!
        Take for example residential networks, or different companies.
        This might pose a problem for determining ID of implicit PvD by
        calculating hash of network layer parameters. On IPv6 this isn't
        a problem due to the use of private addresses and/or MAC addresses
        when generating specific addresses.
        </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Managing PvD lifecycle">

        <t>
	PvDi lifecycle consists of the step when they are created and
        communicated to the nodes, used with the nodes, and finally
	removed when the node loses connectivity. How PvDs are communicated
        to nodes is discussed in <xref target="client_configuration" />.
        Here, we are concerned with a node behavior with respect to PvDs.
        More specifically, here are some the questions:
        </t>

        <t><list style="symbols">

          <t>
          PvDs are received through some interface. Probably they should
          be bound to this interface in a sense that when the interface
          stops PvDs should disappear.
          </t>

          <t>
          Should applications know about relationship between PvDs and
          interfaces, or should they only know for PvDs while some more
          advanced applications would know for the connection?
          </t>

          <t>
          When a node first time learns about PvD, how long is this
          information retained? Until connection ends, or forever with
          some indication that PvD isn't active?
          </t>

          <t>
          Suppose that on a single link there is implicit PvD and at least
          one explicit link. What should node do when implicit PvD
          disappears but explicit is stil present? Could this happen?
          </t>

          <t>
          How can router remove a specific PvD? The only possibility is to send
          all the options with lifetime set to zero. The problem is that not
          all options support lifetime.
          </t>

        </list></t>

	<t>
        Some questions are not specific for PvDs but are also valid for NDP
        in general so they might already have an answer. Still, for completness
        and until we figure out answers, here are they:
	</t>

        <t><list>

          <t>
          There are multiple lifetimes in RA message, and in PvD in particular.
          What if one element of PvD times out, others not? Should only this
          particular element be removed, or the all PvD? For example, what if
          prefix disappears and other elements don't?
          </t>

          <t>
          What if in one RA message there is certain set of parameters, but then
          in the following message some parameters from the first message are
          missing? How should implementation react in that case?
          </t>

        </list></t>

    <section anchor="client_configuration" title="Options to configure hosts with PvDs">

      <t>
      When a router has multiple PvDs there are several options to send this
      information to hosts on a local network. We'll group them into two
      orthogonal cases. The first group are options for unsolicited RAs:
      </t>

      <t><list style="symbols">

        <t>
        Option A1. In every RA router sends all known PvDs, implicit and
        explicit.
        </t>

        <t>
        Option A2. In every RA router sends a subset of known PvDs,
        implicit and explicit. Others are available upon request by
        hosts.
        </t>

        <t>
        Option A3. Router sends RAs with a list of all PvD IDs it knows
        of.
        </t>

        <t>
        Option A4. Router sends RAs with only implicit PvD and indication
        that it supports PvD.
        </t>

      </list></t>

      <t>
      The second group are options when there is solicitation. In this case
      the options are:
      </t>

      <t><list style="symbols">

        <t>
        Option B1. When host sends RS it doesn't include any special options
        about PvD. Router sends RA with all PvDs included.
        </t>

        <t>
        Option B2. When host sends RS it includes an option that indicates
        host's support for PvDs. Router sends RA with all PvDs included.
        If the host doesn't include option to indicate PvD support, the
        router doesn't send any PvDs.
        </t>

        <t>
        Option B3. When host sends RS it can include a list of PvD IDs and
        in that way requests information about specific PvD. There could
        be a wildcard PvD ID that signals to router that every known PvD
        should be sent in the RA.
        </t>

      </list></t>

      <t>
      </t>

      <section title="Unsolicited RAs">

        <section title="Sending all PvDs in every RA (A1)">

        <t>
        In this case router sends in each RA every PvD it knows of.
        </t>

        <t>
        When some PvD is removed the router sends RA without the PvD included
        and in that way signalizes that PvD isn't available anymore. [TBD is
        this how RAs work].
        </t>

        <t>
        Pros of this case is simplicity of implementation. No change in RS
        needed.
        </t>

        <t>
        Cons of this case is that RA message size might grow and make the
        system inefficient. This can be particular problem in wireless
        networks where number of errors is high.
        </t>

        </section>

        <section title="Sending subset of PvDs in every RA (A2)">

        <t>
        In this case router sends in each RA only a certain subset of PvDs it
        knows of. The client (in some way) knows that there are additional
        PvDs so it can ask for them by sending RS message.
        </t>

        <t>
        Pros of this case are that the RA message size can be controlled and
        the client immediatelly knows of (at least) some PvDs.
        </t>

        <t>
        Cons of this case is that there should be a way for router to revoke
        some PvDs.
        </t>

        </section>

        <section title="Sending implicit PvD with a list of PvD IDs (A3)">

        <t>
        In this case router sends in each RA implicit PvD, if it has one
        and a list of all (or subset) of PvD IDs it has. Client needs to
        use RS with included PvD IDs to obtain configuration data for each
        PvD.
        </t>

        </section>

        <section title="Sending only implicit PvD (A4)">

        <t>
        In this case router sends in each RA only implicit PvD, if it has one.
        It might somewhere (some flag) indicate the support for PvDs so that
        clients that receive RA know that they should request PvDs separately.
        </t>

        </section>

      </section>

      <section title="Solicited RAs">

        <t>
        Note that in the case of hosts asking for specific PvDs routers that
        don't know for the given PvD ID will also receive requests! This is
        due to RS being sent to All_Routers multicast address, and not to
        a specific router.
        </t>

          <section title="RS without any change (B1)">

          <t>
          When host sends RS it doesn't include any special options about PvD.
          Router MUST send RA with all PvDs included as there is no way for
          client to request PvDs.
          </t>

          <t>
          This case fits well with the option A1 and option A2. In case of
          the option A2 it incurrs one additional round-trip time!
          </t>

          </section>

          <section title="RS with indication of PvD support (B2)">

          <t>
          When host sends RS it includes an option that indicates host's support
          for PvDs. Router sends RA with all PvDs included. If the host doesn't
          include option to indicate PvD support, the router doesn't send any
          PvDs.
          </t>

          <t>
          When sending response the router has three options:
          </t>

          <t><list style="symbols">

            <t>
            Only PvDs are included in the response, no implicit PvD.
            </t>

            <t>
            Everything router knows, implicit and explicit PvDs, sends
            in a single response.
            </t>

            <t>
            Router sends implicit PvD and a list of known PvD IDs.
            </t>

          </list></t>

          <t>
          Depending on the chosen RS, this case fits with options A1,
          A2 and A3.
          </t>

          </section>

        <section title="RS with request for specific PvDs (B3)">

          <t>
          When host sends RS it can include one or more PvD IDs and in that
          way requests information about specific PvD. There could be a
          wildcard PvD ID that signals to router that every known PvD
          should be sent in the RA.
          </t>

          <t>
          When router sends PvDs in a separate RAs there are two options:
          </t>

          <t><list style="symbols">

            <t>
            Only requested PvD(s) is sent in the RA. In case of wildcard

            </t>

            <t>
            Only requested PvD(s) is sent in the RA. In case of wildcard
            PvD ID subset of known PvD IDs to a router are sent. Others

            Along with requested PvD(s) included is also an implicit PvD.

        <t>
        This case fits with options A1, A2 and A3.

      <t>
      One very important question is how will clients know for what
      purposes the specific PvD is used for. In this section we list
      possible options to achieve that.

      <t>This memo includes no request to IANA.</t>

      <t>All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
      <xref target="I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis">the update of
      RFC 2434</xref> for a guide). If the draft does not require IANA to do
      anything, the section contains an explicit statement that this is the
      case (as above). If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will
      be removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
